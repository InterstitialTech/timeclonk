## timeclonk

A time clock for small groups.

Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/InterstitialTech/timeclonk/blob/main/changelog.md) for new features.

Timeclonk is for multiple users and projects.  Each user must register on the site.  Then you can create projects and add users to them.

Within a project, each user can clock in and out, adding hours.

When its time to distribute funds to users, Timeclonk can compute a distribution of hours based on who worked their hours first.
