## timeclonk

A time clock for small groups.

Create projects, add users to those projects.

Within a project, you can clock in and out, adding hours.  Or import hours from a CSV file.

Timeclonk tracks payments to users so you can see the total unpaid hours worked on a team.

You can compute a distrubution of hours to users based on who worked their hours first.
