## timeclonk

A time clock for small groups.

Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/InterstitialTech/timeclonk/blob/main/changelog.md) for new features.

Timeclonk is for multiple users and projects.  Each user must register on the site.  Once registered, each user can create projects and add users to them.

Within a project, each user can clock in and out, adding hours.  All members of a project have the same pay rate.

When its time to distribute funds to users, Timeclonk can compute a distribution of hours based on who worked their hours first.

Timeclonk keeps track of allocations and payouts so you can tell when the team is about to run out of hours on a project.
